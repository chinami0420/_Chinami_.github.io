        My name is Chinami Iihama, from Japan. Taking this Bootcamp in second
        language is my big challenge. I had worked at an international logistics
        company for 7 years. One day, I realized I don't want the job until my
        retirement and still have time to change my life.
        <br />
        <br />

        So, I have decided to learn coding which I'm interested in and I started
        to work at a cryptocurrency company last summer. I'm very excited about
        my new journey.
